They conducted a project to measure the impact of ocean temperature on various types of sea grass.\nAlthough we will not be looking at sea grass, the ocean temperatures from this data set are perfect for our project.\nThey span over more than 20 years, and are in the exact location we need to be studying.\nUnfortunately, this data set is inconsistent.\nat some of the stations they were testing from, there are large gaps in the data.\nThis makes it appear as through average temperature might be decreasing in some places, but we know this is not true.\nWe will need to filter out these problems and make sure everything is aligned correctly.\n\nOur second data set comes from the US Department of the Interior.\nIt is the data set that aligns with our second set of manatee data.\nIt shows changes in ocean temperature in Southwest Florida.\nThe time span overlaps with our manatee data, and extends into 2015.\nThe only flaw with this is that it also does not have coordinates, so it can not be used for mapping temperature data.\n\nThe following graphs show how average ocean temperatures have changed over a 20 year period.\nThis data comes from the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER's sea grass study.\nWe can see based on these charts that there has been an increase of average ocean temperatures in this region since 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nsea.data <- read.csv(\"~/Downloads/PHY_Fourqurean_002.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nseasum <- sea.data %>%\n  mutate(Year = floor(DecimalYear)) %>%\n  filter(Year >= 2003, Year <= 2023) %>% \n  filter(SITENAME == \"TS/Ph11\") %>%\n  group_by(SITENAME, Year) %>%\n  summarize(avg_temp = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\nggplot(seasum, aes(x = Year, y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Yearly Temperature at Site 11 (2003–2023)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Temperature (°C)\",\n    color = \"Site\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n@FCE\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nggplot(seasum, aes(x = Year, y = avg_temp)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, size = 1.2) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Temperature at Site 11 (2003–2023) with Trendline\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Temperature (°C)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n@FCE\n\n### Methods\n\nThe goal of this study is to understand how manatee behavior is impacted by rising ocean temperatures.\nTo find this out, we will be comparing various sets of manatee data with corresponding water temperature data.\nOur manatee data will come from \\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_.\nThe ocean data is from \\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_ .\n\nOur study area will in Southern Florida, in Everglades National Park as well as the surrounding ocean area.\nUsing measurements from multiple stations, we will examine how ocean temperatures have changed over time.\nThis time span will be from the early 2000's through the present.\nAvailable manatee data is much more limited.\nAs a result, we will have a shorter time span.\nThis should not pose a problem if our water temperature data aligns with our manatee readings.\n\nWe will need to manipulate our data to make it more usable for the project.\nThe manatee data from \\_\\_\\_ currently comes from all of Florida.\nWe will filter it to include only our study area.\nThis data set will just be used to examine how manatee numbers have been changing.\nOur second manatee data set from \\_\\_\\_ shows how 40 different manatees moved over a span of 5 years.\nWe will first need to organize this data by the manatee IDs and remove any irrelevant or unavailable data.\nThen, since some of the tracking data started later, or ended earlier than others, we will need to make multiple different maps dependent on timescale.\n\nManipulations to our ocean data will be more simple.\nBoth data sets are from our study site, but we may filter our some coordinates if they are too far out.\nThe only flaw in these sets are some missing data points or extreme outlires.\nThese will be removed.\n\nTo test our hypothesis, we will be looking at the locations of various manatees over time, as well as the overall populations of adults and calves.\nThis will give us insight into how changing ocean temperatures influence migration patterns and reproductive habits of the manatees in Southern Florida.\n",
